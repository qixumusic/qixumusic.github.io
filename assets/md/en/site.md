## Deployment

I maintain a few mirror sites in order to ensure that my website is
always available regardless of third-party service status.

### Main site

<https://www.qixumusic.com>

### Mirror

<https://qixu.me>

The two sites above are deployed on platforms based on overall network evaluations. Aside from the two top-level domains described above, the following section lists second-level domain deployments.
