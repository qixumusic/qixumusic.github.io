# Introduction

Hello! My name is Qi (pronouns: he/him/his, with a keen awareness of the non-binary, pluralistic, inclusive, and inviting nature of *all* pronouns).

I call myself an interdisciplinary researcher, admitting a multi-faceted identity. Even though I devote myself as a solo pianist, I have strong interests in many other disciplines due to my firm belief in a **non-reductionist and holistic worldview**. Poetically, I explore connections between different disciplines, acknowledging the fascinating complexity of the intellectual world. In particular, I devote myself to borrowing inspirations and methodologies from other disciplines to aid my music study (and vice versa). I firmly believe that at some fundamental level, the world is an irreducible whole, of which the understanding must be holistic. Therefore, in addition to specializing in music (piano in particular), I strive to cultivate my musicianship as a complete human being. As people normally say, one has to be a human first, then a musician.

Dramatically speaking, I am fascinated by the existence of everything that is beautiful (and sublime) in the universe. I believe that the appreciation of the beautiful is the common root from which interdisciplinary studies are made possible in the first place.
